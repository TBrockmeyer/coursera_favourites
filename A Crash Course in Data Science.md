# A Crash Course in Data Science
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-course/
## What is Software Engineering for Data Science:
- SW Engineering: formalizes and abstracts functionality of a set of procedures or tools
- developing a well defined interface to the analysis
## At what point do you need to systematize common tasks and procedures across projects?
Basic rule of thumb:
- do something once: write code that does it, document it briefly
- do it twice: write a function
- do it three times: write a package and document its usage
