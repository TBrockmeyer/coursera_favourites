## A Crash Course in Data Science

(Adapted from official course description) Big Data and Data Science - as important as these two fields are for organizations, as overused they are. What do they mean and what is the role they play? The course is intended for anyone who wants to learn what all the action is about, shedding some light on concepts and terminology for e.g. those who will eventually need to manage data scientists.
